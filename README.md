## Project Overview

The School Management System is a comprehensive web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a robust backend and a user-friendly frontend, offering various modules to manage different aspects of a schoolâ€™s operations. This project has been meticulously crafted to showcase my skills in full-stack web development and plays a pivotal role in my journey towards securing my first job in the tech industry.
